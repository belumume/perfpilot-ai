# PerfPilot AI Demo Video Script

## One-Sentence Summary
PerfPilot AI is a performance analysis tool that helps Next.js developers identify issues, optimize bundle size, and implement targeted improvements to create faster, more efficient applications.

## Strategic Demo Goals
- Demonstrate the practical value of PerfPilot AI for Next.js developers
- Show how it addresses all three hackathon categories (Quality, Speed, AI)
- Present a clear problem → solution → results narrative
- Keep the demo focused and concise (2:30-3:00 minutes)

## Video Structure & Script

### 1. Problem Introduction (20 seconds)
**Visual:** Start with the PerfPilot AI homepage loaded

**Voiceover:**
"Building fast Next.js applications involves identifying performance bottlenecks across components, routing, data fetching, and bundle size. This process is typically manual, time-consuming, and requires significant expertise."

### 2. Solution Overview (20 seconds)
**Visual:** Show the main features of PerfPilot AI on the homepage

**Voiceover:**
"PerfPilot AI helps streamline this process by combining code analysis with AI-powered recommendations to identify performance issues, suggest practical optimizations, and track improvements over time."

### 3. Feature Demonstration (2 minutes)

#### Step 1: Code Analysis (40 seconds)
**Visual:** Navigate to the Analyze page showing the tabs for "Upload Files" and "Paste Code"

**Action:** Click on "Paste Code" tab, then click the "Load Example" button

**Visual:** Show example code loading into the textarea

**Action:** Click "Analyze Performance" button and show the loading state

**Visual:** Show the performance score and overview when results appear

**Voiceover:**
"Let's see how PerfPilot AI works with a Next.js component containing several common performance issues. You can upload files or paste code directly. Our 'Load Example' feature lets you quickly test the analysis capabilities. When we analyze the code, PerfPilot AI identifies performance issues and generates a comprehensive performance score with a visual breakdown."

#### Step 2: Recommendations & Visualizations (40 seconds)
**Visual:** Navigate through the different tabs showing results

**Action:** Click on the Recommendations tab

**Visual:** Show the prioritized recommendations with code examples

**Action:** Scroll through visualizations showing issue distribution

**Voiceover:**
"The recommendations tab provides specific suggestions for improving performance, each prioritized by impact. Code examples are included to make implementation straightforward. The visualizations help you understand your performance issues at a glance - showing distribution by category, severity, and potential impact. This makes it clear where to focus your optimization efforts."

#### Step 3: Bundle Analysis (40 seconds)
**Visual:** Return to the analysis input

**Action:** Change the filename to "package.json" and click "Load Example"

**Visual:** Show the package.json example loading

**Action:** Click "Analyze Bundle Size" button

**Visual:** Show bundle analysis results with visualizations

**Voiceover:**
"PerfPilot AI also analyzes your bundle size by examining your package.json. It identifies heavy dependencies, duplicate functionality, and unnecessary packages that increase load times. Each issue comes with specific recommendations that can help reduce your bundle size and improve performance."

### 4. Additional Features (15 seconds)
**Visual:** Return to the analysis results

**Action:** Click the "Export as Report" button

**Visual:** Show the dashboard with performance tracking

**Voiceover:**
"You can export your analysis as an HTML report to share with your team, and use the dashboard to track improvements over time as you implement the recommendations."

### 5. Conclusion (15 seconds)
**Visual:** Return to the PerfPilot AI homepage

**Voiceover:**
"PerfPilot AI addresses all three hackathon categories with a quality user interface, performance-focused features, and intelligent AI recommendations powered by the Vercel AI SDK. We've built it to help Next.js developers create faster, more efficient applications."

## Production Guidelines

### Preparation
- **Script Your Narration:** Create a detailed script with timing for each section
- **Practice the Flow:** Run through the demo sequence multiple times before recording
- **Clean Environment:** Remove browser bookmarks, notifications, and unrelated tabs

### Recording
- **Tool Selection:** OBS Studio (free) or Loom (simple) for screen recording
- **Resolution:** Record at 1080p with clear audio
- **Mouse Movements:** Move deliberately and pause briefly when highlighting key features
- **Narration:** Speak clearly at a moderate pace, emphasizing key points

### Post-Production
- **Editing:** Keep editing minimal and focused on clarity
- **Transitions:** Use simple fade transitions between major sections
- **Accessibility:** Consider adding captions
- **Length:** Keep the final video between 2:30-3:00 minutes

## Key Elements to Emphasize
- The practical value of identifying performance issues automatically
- How the visualizations make performance problems easier to understand
- The time-saving aspect of having ready-to-implement code examples
- The unique combination of code analysis and bundle size optimization
- The dashboard for tracking improvements over time

> **Note:** This demo script balances showing the technical capabilities of PerfPilot AI while maintaining a professional, straightforward tone. It focuses on demonstrating actual user workflows rather than making grandiose claims, letting the tool's practical benefits speak for themselves.
