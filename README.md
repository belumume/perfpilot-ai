## üìä What PerfPilot AI Analyzes

### Code Analysis
- **Images**: Missing next/image components, dimensions, and priority props
- **Rendering Strategy**: Opportunities for Partial Prerendering and Suspense boundaries
- **Imports**: Large dependencies that could be loaded dynamically
- **Fonts**: Font optimization with next/font
- **Scripts**: Script loading strategies with next/script
- **Components**: Proper use of Server Components and Client Components
- **Routing**: Efficient route handlers and metadata optimization
- **Data Fetching**: Optimized data fetching and revalidation strategies

### Bundle Analysis
- **Heavy Dependencies**: Identify large packages increasing bundle size
- **Unnecessary Dependencies**: Detect packages that aren't needed in Next.js projects
- **Duplicate Functionality**: Find multiple packages serving the same purpose
- **Tree-shaking Issues**: Identify import patterns preventing effective tree-shaking
- **Bundle Score**: Get an overall assessment of your bundle health

## üìà Data Visualization

PerfPilot AI provides rich, interactive data visualizations to help you understand your performance metrics:

- **Performance Score Distribution**: Area chart showing your score in relation to performance zones
- **Issues by Category**: Bar chart showing the distribution of issues across different categories
- **Issues by Severity**: Pie chart displaying the proportion of critical, warning, and info issues
- **Performance by Category**: Radar chart visualizing performance scores across all categories
- **Bundle Size Distribution**: Pie chart showing the distribution of dependency issues
- **Heaviest Dependencies**: Bar chart identifying the largest packages in your bundle

## üîß Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perfpilot-ai.git
   cd perfpilot-ai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to use PerfPilot AI.

## üí° How to Use

1. Navigate to the "Analyze" page
2. Choose to either:
   - Upload your Next.js files (supports multiple files)
   - Paste your Next.js code directly
3. Click "Analyze Performance"
4. View the detailed analysis results, including:
   - Performance score and interactive charts
   - Issue categories and severity breakdown
   - Specific detected issues
   - AI recommendations with code examples
   - Performance insights and metrics
   - Bundle analysis (when applicable)
5. Optionally:
   - Export your results as JSON or HTML reports
   - Save your analysis to the dashboard to track improvements over time

## üß™ Test Files

We've included sample files for testing PerfPilot AI's analysis capabilities. These are organized into two categories:

### JSX Test Files
Located in the `test_files/jsx` directory:
- `blog-page.jsx`: Example blog page component with various performance issues
- `dashboard.jsx`: Dashboard component with optimization opportunities
- `hero-section.jsx`: Hero section with image and layout issues
- `layout.jsx`: Layout component with font and metadata optimization needs
- `product-page.jsx`: Product page with data fetching and rendering issues

**Usage Tip**: For best results, upload all JSX files together for a more comprehensive analysis.

### Bundle Analysis Test Files
Located in the `test_files/bundle` directory:
- `comprehensive-package.json`: Contains multiple types of bundle issues
- `duplicate-functionality-package.json`: Features redundant packages serving similar purposes
- `heavy-deps-package.json`: Includes unnecessarily large dependencies
- `treeshaking-package.json`: Demonstrates problematic import patterns
- `unnecessary-deps-package.json`: Contains packages not needed in Next.js projects

**Usage Tip**: Upload these files individually to see different types of bundle analysis insights.
