## **PerfPilot AI: Development Summary & Context for Continuation**

This summary outlines the development progress, challenges, and current status of the "PerfPilot AI" project, intended for the Next.js Global Hackathon.

**1\. Project Goal & Hackathon Context:**

* **Objective:** Build an AI-powered tool ("PerfPilot AI") to analyze Next.js application code, identify performance issues, and provide actionable recommendations.  
* **Hackathon:** The project is being developed for the Next.js Global Hackathon (April 7-17, 2025). Key judging criteria include "Highest Quality App," "Fastest App," and "Best Use of AI" (with bonus points for using the Vercel AI SDK). The original project plan details the strategic approach to align with these criteria.

**2\. Core Technologies:**

* **Framework:** Next.js (initially targeting v15 Canary with App Router)  
* **UI:** Shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS  
* **AI:** Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI API (GPT-4o)  
* **Analysis:** Custom static analysis rules (lib/analysis/rules.ts, lib/analysis/analyzer.ts)  
* **Bundle Analysis:** Package dependency analysis (lib/analysis/bundle-analyzer.ts)
* **Syntax Highlighting:** react-syntax-highlighter
* **Data Visualization:** Recharts for interactive performance charts
* **Storage:** Local storage for saving analysis history

**3\. Initial Development & Challenges (Generative UI Attempt):**

* The initial approach focused on using the Vercel AI SDK's **Generative UI** capabilities (createStreamableUI) to have the AI directly render React components for the analysis results and recommendations.  
* An API endpoint (/api/analyze) was created to handle code input (text area or file upload), perform static analysis, and call the AI model via lib/ai/generative-ui.ts.  
* **Significant roadblocks were encountered:**  
  * **Build/Runtime Errors:**  
    * Missing Badge component import (@/components/ui/badge).  
    * Incorrect Vercel AI SDK import (render from ai/rsc instead of createStreamableUI).  
    * Invalid next.config.ts structure for experimental.serverActions.  
  * **Generative UI Issues:** Even after fixing the initial errors, the streamable UI approach led to:  
    * A persistent client-side React error: Uncaught Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {value}), indicating the AI SDK was returning data incompatible with direct React rendering in this setup.  
    * A server-side warning: The streamable UI has been slow to update... forgot to call .done(), suggesting potential issues with the streaming implementation or lifecycle.

**4\. Pivot to Simplified Approach & Current Implementation:**

* Due to the persistent Generative UI issues and the time constraints of the hackathon, a **pivot** was made to a simpler, more reliable approach.  
* **Generative UI Removed:** The createStreamableUI integration (lib/ai/generative-ui.ts) was abandoned and commented out.  
* **API Route Update (/api/analyze/route.ts):**  
  * The API now performs the analysis (single or multiple files).  
  * It calls a separate AI function (lib/ai/generate-recommendations.ts) which uses generateText from the Vercel AI SDK to get text-based summary and recommendations from the LLM.  
  * The API returns a standard **JSON response** containing the structured analysis results (analysis: { issues, summary / fileResults, aggregateSummary }) and the AI-generated text (recommendations: { summary, recommendations: string\[\] }).  
* **Frontend Component Update (components/analyze/analysis-results.tsx):**  
  * This component now receives the JSON response from the API.  
  * It uses standard React state (useState) to manage the display.  
  * It renders the analysis summary (issue counts) and detailed detected issues using Shadcn UI components (Card, Tabs, Badge, etc.).  
  * It displays the AI-generated summary text directly.  
  * It **parses** the array of AI-generated recommendation strings:  
    * Extracts code examples using regular expressions.  
    * Cleans the recommendation text (removes code blocks).  
    * Determines a priority level ('high', 'medium', 'low') based on keywords in the text.  
  * It successfully implements **syntax highlighting** for all code snippets (detected issues and AI examples) using react-syntax-highlighter and the vscDarkPlus theme.  
* **Configuration Fixes:** The next.config.ts was corrected (currently empty, removing the problematic experimental block). The missing Badge component was added.

**5\. Enhanced Performance Analysis Rules:**

* Expanded the static analysis rules in `lib/analysis/rules.ts` to include additional Next.js 14/15 specific patterns:
  * Server Components and Client Components interaction patterns
  * App Router metadata optimization
  * Route Handler optimization with Edge Runtime
  * Efficient data fetching with revalidation
  * React Server Components usage
  * Error handling patterns
  * Navigation with Link component
* Added support for new categories including 'components', 'data', and 'routing'

**6\. UI/UX Improvements & Data Visualization:**

* **Interactive Data Visualization:** Added Recharts library to create beautiful, interactive charts in the Performance Insights tab:
  * **Radar Chart:** Visualizes performance scores across different categories
  * **Pie Chart:** Shows distribution of issues by severity (critical, warning, info)
  * **Bar Chart:** Displays number of issues by category
  * **Area Chart:** Illustrates performance score distribution with contextual zones
* **Enhanced UI Organization:**
  * Implemented a tabbed interface for Overview, Recommendations, Issues, and Insights

  * Fixed type errors in the analysis results interface to handle bundle-specific data

* **Bundle Analysis Implementation Issues:**
  * **JSON Parsing Problems:** Currently experiencing issues with parsing certain JSON files, particularly those with comments or non-standard formatting
  * **Multiple File Handling:** When uploading multiple package.json files, only the first one is analyzed, and if it has parsing errors, the entire analysis fails
  * **Error Recovery:** The JSON cleaning functionality works for simpler JSON issues but fails with more complex formatting problems
  * **AI Integration Gap:** The bundle analysis doesn't consistently integrate with the AI recommendation system compared to code analysis
  * **Testing Samples:** Created test files (heavy-deps-package.json, unnecessary-deps-package.json, duplicate-functionality-package.json, etc.) to verify different aspects of bundle analysis

**9\. Export Functionality Implementation:**

* **Export Feature Addition:**
  * Implemented comprehensive export functionality in the `components/analyze/analysis-results.tsx` component
  * Added two export options accessible via buttons in the interface header:
    * **Export as JSON:** Allows users to download the complete raw analysis data for integration with other tools
    * **Export as HTML Report:** Generates a formatted, styled HTML report that can be shared with team members

* **Technical Implementation Details:**

  * Made buttons compact to avoid overwhelming the interface
  * Ensured export functionality works across all result types (code analysis, bundle analysis, or combined)

**10\. Bundle Analysis Improvements:**

* **Enhanced JSON Parsing:**
  * Completely rewrote the JSON parsing functionality in `lib/analysis/bundle-analyzer.ts` with multiple fallback strategies:
    * **Strategy 1:** Direct JSON.parse for standard JSON
    * **Strategy 2:** Content cleaning and repair before parsing
    * **Strategy 3:** JavaScript object evaluation as fallback
    * **Strategy 4:** Targeted extraction of just dependencies sections when all else fails
  * Enhanced the `cleanJsonContent()` function to handle multiple common issues:
    * Comments (both line and block) in JSON files
    * Trailing commas in objects and arrays
    * Unquoted property names (common in relaxed JSON formats)
    * Single quotes instead of double quotes
    * Invalid escape sequences in strings (especially Windows paths)
    * Control characters that might break parsing
  * Added detailed logging to help identify parsing issues
