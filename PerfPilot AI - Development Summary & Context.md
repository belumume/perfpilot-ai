## **PerfPilot AI: Development Summary & Context for Continuation**

This summary outlines the development progress, challenges, and current status of the "PerfPilot AI" project, intended for the Next.js Global Hackathon.

**1\. Project Goal & Hackathon Context:**

* **Objective:** Build an AI-powered tool ("PerfPilot AI") to analyze Next.js application code, identify performance issues, and provide actionable recommendations.  
* **Hackathon:** The project is being developed for the Next.js Global Hackathon (April 7-17, 2025). Key judging criteria include "Highest Quality App," "Fastest App," and "Best Use of AI" (with bonus points for using the Vercel AI SDK). The original project plan details the strategic approach to align with these criteria.

**2\. Core Technologies:**

* **Framework:** Next.js (initially targeting v15 Canary with App Router)  
* **UI:** Shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS  
* **AI:** Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI API (GPT-4o)  
* **Analysis:** Custom static analysis rules (lib/analysis/rules.ts, lib/analysis/analyzer.ts)  
* **Syntax Highlighting:** react-syntax-highlighter
* **Data Visualization:** Recharts for interactive performance charts

**3\. Initial Development & Challenges (Generative UI Attempt):**

* The initial approach focused on using the Vercel AI SDK's **Generative UI** capabilities (createStreamableUI) to have the AI directly render React components for the analysis results and recommendations.  
* An API endpoint (/api/analyze) was created to handle code input (text area or file upload), perform static analysis, and call the AI model via lib/ai/generative-ui.ts.  
* **Significant roadblocks were encountered:**  
  * **Build/Runtime Errors:**  
    * Missing Badge component import (@/components/ui/badge).  
    * Incorrect Vercel AI SDK import (render from ai/rsc instead of createStreamableUI).  
    * Invalid next.config.ts structure for experimental.serverActions.  
  * **Generative UI Issues:** Even after fixing the initial errors, the streamable UI approach led to:  
    * A persistent client-side React error: Uncaught Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {value}), indicating the AI SDK was returning data incompatible with direct React rendering in this setup.  
    * A server-side warning: The streamable UI has been slow to update... forgot to call .done(), suggesting potential issues with the streaming implementation or lifecycle.

**4\. Pivot to Simplified Approach & Current Implementation:**

* Due to the persistent Generative UI issues and the time constraints of the hackathon, a **pivot** was made to a simpler, more reliable approach.  
* **Generative UI Removed:** The createStreamableUI integration (lib/ai/generative-ui.ts) was abandoned and commented out.  
* **API Route Update (/api/analyze/route.ts):**  
  * The API now performs the analysis (single or multiple files).  
  * It calls a separate AI function (lib/ai/generate-recommendations.ts) which uses generateText from the Vercel AI SDK to get text-based summary and recommendations from the LLM.  
  * The API returns a standard **JSON response** containing the structured analysis results (analysis: { issues, summary / fileResults, aggregateSummary }) and the AI-generated text (recommendations: { summary, recommendations: string\[\] }).  
* **Frontend Component Update (components/analyze/analysis-results.tsx):**  
  * This component now receives the JSON response from the API.  
  * It uses standard React state (useState) to manage the display.  
  * It renders the analysis summary (issue counts) and detailed detected issues using Shadcn UI components (Card, Tabs, Badge, etc.).  
  * It displays the AI-generated summary text directly.  
  * It **parses** the array of AI-generated recommendation strings:  
    * Extracts code examples using regular expressions.  
    * Cleans the recommendation text (removes code blocks).  
    * Determines a priority level ('high', 'medium', 'low') based on keywords in the text.  
  * It successfully implements **syntax highlighting** for all code snippets (detected issues and AI examples) using react-syntax-highlighter and the vscDarkPlus theme.  
* **Configuration Fixes:** The next.config.ts was corrected (currently empty, removing the problematic experimental block). The missing Badge component was added.

**5\. Enhanced Performance Analysis Rules:**

* Expanded the static analysis rules in `lib/analysis/rules.ts` to include additional Next.js 14/15 specific patterns:
  * Server Components and Client Components interaction patterns
  * App Router metadata optimization
  * Route Handler optimization with Edge Runtime
  * Efficient data fetching with revalidation
  * React Server Components usage
  * Error handling patterns
  * Navigation with Link component
* Added support for new categories including 'components', 'data', and 'routing'

**6\. UI/UX Improvements & Data Visualization:**

* **Interactive Data Visualization:** Added Recharts library to create beautiful, interactive charts in the Performance Insights tab:
  * **Radar Chart:** Visualizes performance scores across different categories
  * **Pie Chart:** Shows distribution of issues by severity (critical, warning, info)
  * **Bar Chart:** Displays number of issues by category
  * **Area Chart:** Illustrates performance score distribution with contextual zones
* **Enhanced UI Organization:**
  * Implemented a tabbed interface for Overview, Recommendations, Issues, and Insights
  * Added tooltips for better context on metrics
  * Added copy buttons for code examples
  * Improved visual hierarchy with cards and badges
* **User Experience Improvements:**
  * Added performance score calculation and visualization
  * Enhanced the landing page with more descriptive feature showcases
  * Added hackathon banner and context
  * Improved responsive layout for all device sizes

**7\. Performance Optimizations:**

* Enabled Partial Prerendering (PPR) for faster initial page loads
* Added Suspense boundaries around content that can be loaded asynchronously
* Configured PPR globally in the next.config.js
* Optimized component loading with dynamic imports

**8\. Current Status:**

* The application is **fully functional** with a rich, interactive UI:
  * It correctly analyzes single or multiple uploaded code files based on predefined rules
  * It successfully calls the OpenAI API via the Vercel AI SDK to get detailed performance recommendations
  * It displays analysis results and AI recommendations in a well-structured, visually appealing UI
  * It provides interactive data visualizations for better understanding of performance metrics
  * It highlights code examples with syntax highlighting
* **Performance:** The app is performant with PPR enabled and proper Suspense boundaries
* **UI Quality:** The UI is polished with consistent styling, responsive design, and intuitive layout
* **AI Integration:** Successfully leverages the Vercel AI SDK for intelligent analysis

**9\. Next Steps:**

* **Further Analysis Enhancement:** Add more advanced analysis techniques, such as:
  * Bundle size analysis for uploaded projects
  * Runtime performance analysis simulation
  * Integration with Lighthouse API for real-world metrics
* **AI Improvements:** Enhance the AI recommendations by:
  * Training or fine-tuning a model specifically for Next.js performance patterns
  * Implementing more context-aware recommendations based on project structure
  * Adding support for project-wide refactoring suggestions
* **Export and Sharing:** Add the ability to export analysis results or share them
* **Dashboard View:** Create a dashboard to track improvements over time for returning users
* **Integration with Next.js Ecosystem:** Explore integration with Vercel deployment analytics or other tools
